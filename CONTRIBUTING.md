# Contributing to WHMCS-Slack

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

To lay out some guidelines and rules on how to contribute I decided to write this page. 
I want to make it as easy as possible to contribute while still keeping the code in a 
good state.

- Please submit bug reports with a clear and descriptive title along with a detailed 
description on how the problem can be reproduced.

- Ideas, check if there are any existing issues with the same idea first and if there
are none, simply open a new issue with a detailed description of the idea you have.

- Adding or fixing code, please fork this repository and do a pull request. I will do my
best to review the pull request within a few days. Please add a clear description of what
the code should do or fix.

All code contributed falls under the MIT license. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
